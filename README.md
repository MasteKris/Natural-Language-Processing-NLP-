# Project: Language Analysis Web App

I developed a project for the "Natural Language Processing (NLP)" course. The chosen topic was "Text Analysis for Used Languages."

## Overview
The goal was to create a web application where users could input sentences into a table. The interface includes three buttons:

1) **Choose File**: Allows users to select a file, and adjacent to it is a field indicating the chosen file.
2) **Insert File**: Inserts the selected file into the table.
3) **Check**: Performs several functions:
  3.1) Identifies the languages in which the text is written.
  3.2) Performs detailed text analysis.

## Technologies Used
I utilized various libraries in my project, including but not limited to:

- langdetect==1.0.9
- langid==1.1.6
- nltk==3.8.1

Additionally, I incorporated AI assistance to navigate through Django framework in Python. As it was my first time working with Django and Python, I also leveraged my experience with Visual Studio (C#) to facilitate the development process.
